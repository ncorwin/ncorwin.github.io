<p>Natalie has been working with robots for most of her educational career.</p>

<p>She was first introduced to engineering through the FIRST robotics competition in high school home in Colorado, and from there studied Mechanical Engineering at Trinity College while taking every opportunity available to learn more about robotics.</p>

<p>She was a leader on Trinity’s Robot Study team, and specifically lead design teams in Trinity’s International Robot Contest for both the advanced Robowaiter and advanced Firefighting divisions. She also lead a design team in continuing development of an autonomous boat. Now, she is excited to hone his technical skills while formally studying robotics at Northwestern.</p>

<p>In addition to the engineering work, she made time to also study art and design during her undergraduate time, even getting a minor in studio arts and winning one of Trinity’s art achievement awards. She works with a variety of mediums including charcoal, pastel, and CG drawing, woodworking, collage, and photography.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, she is an avid martial artist, having studied Kempo Karate for ten years and Iaido for four. She also enjoys snowboarding when the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>Nathan has been working with robots for most of his educational career.</p>

<p>He was first introduced to engineering through the FIRST robotics competition in high school home in Colorado, and from there studied Mechanical Engineering at Trinity College while taking every opportunity available to learn more about robotics.</p>

<p>He was a leader on Trinity’s Robot Study team, and specifically lead design teams in Trinity’s International Robot Contest for both the advanced Robowaiter and advanced Firefighting divisions. He also lead a design team in continuing development of an autonomous boat. Now, he is excited to hone his technical skills while formally studying robotics at Northwestern.</p>

<p>In addition to the engineering work, he made time to also study art and design during his undergraduate time, even getting a minor in studio arts and winning one of Trinity’s art achievement awards. He works with a variety of mediums including charcoal, pastel, and CG drawing, woodworking, collage, and photography.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, he is an avid martial artist, having studied Kempo Karate for ten years and Iaido for four. He also enjoys snowboarding when the opportunity arises.</p>
